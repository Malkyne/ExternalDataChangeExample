# ExternalDataChangeExample

This is a quick, minimalist example of a problem I was discussing over on Gitter: https://gitter.im/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia?at=60c0f3ec9cc69444a02c7e29

Specifically, using Avalonia, I have a case where I need to change the backing data for individual records within an `ObservableCollection`.  However, my chnages are not being reflected in the UI which the ObservableCollection is bound to.  I am trying to figure out the appropriate way to accomplish this data change, with the UI updating properly.

I will be removing this example, when it is of no further use, but until then, you are welcome to comment.
